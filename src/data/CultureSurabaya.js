        title: "Ludruk",
        description : `Bantengan, derived from Ponorogo's Kebo-keboan art that grows in Malang, originated as a ritual to protect King Paku Buwana II of Surakarta. Martial artists from Mojokerto, Malang, and Batu adapted it to use a bull, an endangered local species, promoting Pencak Silat. Influenced by Malang’s Candi Jago reliefs, early Bantengan used buffalo horns, but post-2000, bull horns became common with internet access. Some still use buffalo horns to honor the tradition. The black-and-red costumes resemble Ponorogo's traditional attire. Bantengan, initially popular in Mojokerto, Malang, and Batu, is now also preserved in Jombang and Kediri.`,
