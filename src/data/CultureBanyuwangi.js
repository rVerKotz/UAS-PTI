        title: "Gandrung Dance",
        description: "Gandrung Dance is the most eagerly anticipated event by both local and international tourists. Known as the City of Gandrung, Banyuwangi is closely associated with the iconic Gandrung dancers. The term 'gandrung' means admiration, reflecting the Blambangan people's adoration for the incomparable Dewi Sri, the goddess of fertility and prosperity for agrarian societies. The Gandrung Dance has a long and poignant history, originating during the Bayu War between the Blambangan people and the colonial forces. Originally, the dance was a symbol of resistance and the struggle to rebuild the devastated capital of Blambangan. Today, it is performed as an expression of gratitude for bountiful harvests. The Gandrung Sewu Festival is a grand event featuring a thousand female dancers from across Banyuwangi, symbolizing the importance of collective effort in cultural preservation.",
